This is the Gedit Synctex Plugin. 

This is a work in progress to support synctex (both Backward/ForwardSearch)
using gedit and evince.

One cool thing about the plugin is that it does not require configuration. 
 
To use ForwardSearch, use the Menu Tools->ForwardSearch. 
To use BackwardSearch, ctrl-click in Evince in the position you want. 

Note: BackwardSearch won't work if the main file used to compile the pdf is not opened in Evince. 

When this plugin is stable enough, it may be moved to gnome repositories.
